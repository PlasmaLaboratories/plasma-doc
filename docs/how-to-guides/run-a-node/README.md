# Run a Node

### What is a Node?

A node is a computer or device that connects to a blockchain network, verifies transactions, and maintains a copy of the blockchain ledger. Nodes are the backbone of a blockchain, allowing the network to operate decentralized, secure, and transparently.

Plasma nodes are essential to the Plasma Protocol ecosystem, operating across multiple networks to maintain the blockchain's functionality. Each node runs the same [`Plasma-node`](https://github.com/PlasmaLaboratories/plasma-node) codebase but can be configured differently based on its purpose and network type.

### Supported Networks <a href="#supported-networks" id="supported-networks"></a>

Plasma operates across four distinct network environments, each serving different purposes.

* **Mainnet**: Production network where real Plasma tokens are used
* **Testnet**: A testing environment for developers and validators
* **Devnet**: Development network for experimental features
* **Private Network**: Custom isolated network for specific use cases

### **Network Comparison**

| Network Type    | Purpose                 | Use Case                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Mainnet         | Production environment  | Live applications, real transactions        |
| Testnet         | Testing environment     | Development testing, validator testing      |
| Devnet          | Development environment | Experimental features, early testing        |
| Private Network | Isolated environment    | Custom implementations, private deployments |

### **Why Run a Node**  <a href="#why-run-a-node" id="why-run-a-node"></a>

Reasons why you should run a node:

* To help secure the network
* To validate transactions and earn rewards
* To improve application performance with dedicated RPC access
* To develop and test in isolation
* To gather blockchain data for analytics

### **Node Types** <a href="#node-types" id="node-types"></a>

* **Validator Nodes:** Process transactions and secure the network
* **RPC Nodes:** Handle API requests and serve data
* **Archive Nodes:** Store complete blockchain history
